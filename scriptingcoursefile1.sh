# Hello! Welcome to the first script file!
# Anything with a hashtag will not show up and won't give an error when you run the script
# In this, you will learn basic commands with scripting, and you will learn about variables.
# Let's start with basic commands
# Type "echo 'Hello World!'" to print a Hello World! message.
Remove this, then type here
# 'echo' is the linux command for 'print'
# Now for variables!
# A variable is made with 'read' or 'let'
# Let's make a variable! Type "let" then the name of the variable
Remove this, then type here
# Now, type after the name of the variable an equals sign. Then, in quotation marks, type "variable"
# A dollar sign will call a variable. For example, if there was a variable named 'v', it would be called by $v
# So after the $, type the name of your variable.
echo "This is a $"
# There we go!
# You made a variable!
# Press CTRL+X to exit, then type 'y', then press enter
# Also, to run a script, type 'bash' then the filename. Example: 'bash scriptingcoursefile1.sh'
# Now, as a test to get into a new script, go into the editor for the file scriptingcoursefile2.sh
# There, you will debug the script, and you will learn about the 'read' variable statement
