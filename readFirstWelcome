Hello!
Don't worry, this isn't a script

In this course, you will learn basic scripting, and you will make and debug scripts!
If you have any questions, go to https://github.com/HarrisonDNET/Getting-Started-with-Scripting-Linux and comment.
In the first script, you will learn and modify it so that you can make your first script!
The first file is scriptingcoursefile1.sh
Type
nano scriptingcoursefile1.sh
to start the course!
